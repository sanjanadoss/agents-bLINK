Today, we have a wide variety of apps/sites to get internships/jobs but noticing the market we have felt that there is no app in which we can gain access to part time jobs. The app acts as a middle man and provides hourly pay for a particular job to be done. The work can range from baby sitting to cashier at shops to handle prime time customers.
